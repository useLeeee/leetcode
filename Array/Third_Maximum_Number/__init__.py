__question__ = 'Given a non-empty array of integers, return the third maximum number in this array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity must be in O(n).'
__example1__ = 'Input:[3, 2, 1]\
                Output:1\
                Explanation: The third maximum is 1.'
__example2__ = 'Input:[1, 2]\
                Output:2\
                Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.'

                Output:1\
                Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.\
                             Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum..'
